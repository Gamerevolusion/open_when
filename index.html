                My Sweetheart,<br>
                If you miss me even a little,
                know that I’m probably thinking about you too.
                Maybe in the middle of my day,
                maybe while doing nothing at all,
                maybe at some random moment where your face just pops into my mind.

                You’re not someone I forget.
                You’re someone I feel! even from a distance!

                Until I see you again,
                hold onto that tiny piece of me that you carry everywhere.
                I promise I’m holding onto yours just as firmly.
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-message">
                <b>Come here darling 🫂<br>
                I’d pull you close… not tight, not overwhelming… just firm enough for you to feel grounded.
                I’d place my chin on your head because that’s where you fit best.
                I’d hold your waist gently, pull you into my chest, and just breathe with you until everything calms down.

                You don’t have to explain anything.
                You don’t have to be strong right now.
                You’re allowed to melt a little.
                If I were there, I wouldn’t say much, I’d let the hug do the talking.
                So for now, feel this:
                you’re safe, you’re cared for, and you’re not alone.

                We’ll handle life after the hug.
                Right now?
                Just stay here with me for a minute.</b>

            <div class="hidden-message">
                <b>Slow down, princess. You’re carrying too much in that beautiful head. 🫂</b><br>
                I know you push yourself,
                I know you don’t like showing cracks,
                and I know you hate when people tell you to “relax” like it’s something you can switch on and off.
                Whatever is stressing you right now…
                it’s temporary.
                You’ve survived every single thing life has thrown at you so far.

                And you’re not handling stuff alone anymore.
                You have me.
                Not to fix your life for you, but to walk through it with you.
                To remind you that you don’t have to break yourself to prove anything.

                Come back to me when your mind is heavy.
                Let me carry a little bit of it with you.
                Here is what I want you to do:
                Take one deep breath...just one...because you owe yourself that much.

                If your eyes are tired and your mind isn’t…
                come lie down beside me in your imagination.

                I’d put your head on my chest,
                run my fingers through your hair,
                and talk to you softly until your breathing slowed down.
                I’d pull the blanket over both of us,
                kiss your forehead
                and tell you,
                <b>"Sleep, love. I’m right here."</b>

                Whatever thoughts are keeping you awake they’re not stronger than your peace.
                And you deserve that peace tonight.

                Close your eyes.
                Rest.
                I’ll still be here in the morning.

                Good.
                Because I think about you that way more often than you think.
                            
                If I was with you right now,
                I’d pull you close by the waist,
                look into your eyes,
                and let that tension build...deliberately.
                            
                I wouldn’t rush you.
                I’d read your body,
                your breathing,
                those tiny reactions you can never hide.
                            
                And when you finally look at me with that "don’t stop" expression…
                I’d kiss you the way you deserve it,
                slow, deep, unapologetically intense.
                            
                But until I can do all that for real,
                just know this:
                your desire doesn’t scare me,
                it doesn’t overwhelm me,
                and it definitely doesn’t go one-sided.
                            
                Whenever you want me in that way…
                trust me, I’m right there with you.</b>

                I won’t defend myself or argue right now.
                Just listen to this one thing:
                I care about you way too much to ignore how you’re feeling.
                If something I did hurt you,
                you have the right to be upset.
                And I have the responsibility to understand it, fix it, and grow from it.

                Take your time.
                Breathe.
                You don’t need to solve it instantly.
                And I’m not going anywhere just because things are tense.

                You’re allowed to be angry.
                You’re allowed to be disappointed.
                And I’m here, ready to listen when you’re ready to talk.

                No ego.
                No excuses.
                Just me wanting to make things right with you.

                I didn’t choose you casually.
                I chose you because you feel right in every way that matters,
                even on days when things feel off.

                We’ll have misunderstandings.
                We’ll annoy each other.

                You’re worth the effort.
                You’re worth the days where things feel a little uncertain.

                If your mind ever scares you,
